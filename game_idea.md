This text file is used for outlining the idea of the game.

The theme "divide and conquer" implies that the player will be the one dividing, whether that means
dividing themselves or dividing the enemy from itself.

Potential ideas:
  - Room full of enemies, the best way to approach this is to place some sort of barricade,
effectively "dividing"/separating enemies from the group, allowing them to be easily "conquered".
  - Player can somehow "divide" themself, creating two player controlled entities, which will be
used to solve/complete a level
  - Some sort of turn-based puzzle game, in which the player must manage the "division" of hostile
territories into weaker, more managable pieces.

Potential genres of game:
  - strategy
  - puzzle
  - bullet hell?
