This text file is used for outlining the idea of the game.

The theme "divide and conquer" implies that the player will be the one dividing, whether that means
dividing themselves or dividing the enemy from itself.

Potential ideas:
  - Room full of enemies, the best way to approach this is to place some sort of barricade,
effectively "dividing"/separating enemies from the group, allowing them to be easily "conquered".
  - Player can somehow "divide" themself, creating two player controlled entities, which will be
used to solve/complete a level
  - Some sort of turn-based puzzle game, in which the player must manage the "division" of hostile
territories into weaker, more managable pieces.

Potential genres of game:
  - strategy
  - puzzle
  - bullet hell?

BREAKOUT-LIKE game idea
	like breakout, but with flexible borders

Similarly to breakout, there is a ball and tiles that the ball may damage and destroy.  However,
unlike breakout, the player controlls the walls of a rectangle which keeps the ball inside.  Thus,
the player cannot loose, so the game becomes one about high score.

MANPOWER game idea
	A war game with a simple economy

Economy:
	Resources:
		Population
		Food
		Materials
		Army
	Resource generation:
		Population is generated from cities
		Food is generated from farms
		Materials are generated in the countryside
		Army is generated at bases
	Resource use:
		Population is what is distributed to different industries, and is neccessary for resource
				Generation
		Food is required to feed a given population, with the more food, the higher population
				gain.  Starvation is a possibility if there isn't enough food
		Materials are used for building the structures that generate resources
		Army is used for conquering new territories.  The only resource that consumes population
	Allocation:
		Men are gained each round based on their generation from cities
		Men can be distributed accross the industries.
	Conversions:
		10 manpower + 10 food = 1 population
		1 manpower = 5 food
		1 population consumes 1 food
		5 manpower = 1 army
		3 manpower = 1 material
		30 materials = city
		5 materials = farm
		20 materials = mine
		10 materials = base
